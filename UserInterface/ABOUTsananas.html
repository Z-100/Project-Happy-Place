        <h3>The developers:</h3>
        <p>
            Well, the developer team of <i>SANANAS: The actual game</i> actually consists 
            of one single person, who coded and animated the whole game in 9th grade
            during a project phase in just one third of a year!Â¨<br><br>
            His motivation was: "<i>I want to program some stupid game</i>" and so he did.<br><br>
        </p>
        <h3>The logo: </h3>
        <img class="logo" src="../img/output-onlinepngtools.png" style="width:20%;" alt="sananaslogo">
        <p>
            (This part of the "about" page only exists, because of a certain group of
            people who share their name with an overpriced bakery).<br><br>

            The logo of SANANAS was inspired by a famous website: 
            <a href="http://corn-hub.blogspot.com/"><i>The Hub</i></a>. AND NOTHING ELSE!<br><br>

            I don't know why people are telling me, my logo is inapropirate. Also I don't know 
            why a certain group of the human species(XY) is laughing, the moment this logo
            appears on any screen. lol
        </p>
        <h3>SANANAS, the milestone: </h3>
        <p>
            I hope I won't have to point out that SANANAS is a great game, because it absolutely is
            and you can't say anything different because you're not allowed to!<br>But did <b>you</b> 
            know, that SANANAS: The actual game was a milestone in game developement in general?
            Yes you heard right!<br>SANANAS is the kind of game, you'd expect <i>not</i> to use lots
            of VRAM, RAM and CPU power, but it does! Isn't that great?<br>You can play Doom on a calculator,
            but have to buy the latest GPUs and CPUs to play SANANAS? Yes! Absolutely! You have to! And no, I'm not
            sponsored by any GPU or CPU manufacturer!<br>
            This game was meant to be played by the elite. The ones who can afford that kind of unnecessary expensive
            hardware. <br>The rich people, like you know, the ones with money.
