        <h2>The devs:</h2>
        <p>
            It's just one 16 years old boy, who has no idea on how to work
            or do anything with MySQL, so I'm sorry if this website isn't 
            working the way it should. So uhm idk.. Just be amazed by the 
            websites design, which totally wasn't stolen from one of his
            previous projects :)
        </p>

        <h2>More Projects by the Devs!</h2>
        
        <h3>SANANAS: The actual Game</h3>

        <h3>The logo: </h3>
        <img class="logo" src="img/output-onlinepngtools.png" alt="">
        <p>
            (This part of the "about" page only exists, because of a certain group of
            people who share their name with an overpriced bakery).<br><br>

            The logo of SANANAS was inspired by a famous website: 
            <a href="http://corn-hub.blogspot.com/">The Hub</a>. AND NOTHING ELSE!<br><br>

            I don't know why people are calling out my logo as inapropirate. Also I don't know 
            why a certain group of the human species(XY) is laughing, the moment this logo
            appears on any screen. lol
        </p>
        <h3>SANANAS, the milestone: </h3>
        <p>
            I hope I won't have to point out that SANANAS is a great game, because it absolutely is
            and you can't say anything different to this because you're not allowed to!<br>But did <b>you</b> 
            know, that SANANAS: The actual game was a milestone in game developement in general?
            Yes you heard right!<br>SANANAS is the kind of game, you'd expect <i>not</i> to use lots
            of VRAM, RAM and CPU power, but it does! Isn't that great?<br>You can play Doom on a calculator,
            but have to buy the latest GPUs and CPUs to play SANANAS? Yes! Absolutely! You have to! And no, I'm not
            sponsored by any GPU or CPU manufacturer!<br>
            This game was meant to be played by the elite. The ones who can afford that kind of unnecessary expensive
            hardware. <br>The rich people, like you know, the ones with money.
